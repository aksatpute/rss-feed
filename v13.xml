<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>The aesthetics of modern Chinese digital products can look very different to primarily English-based apps and websites. If you explore some of China’s most popular websites and apps, such as 163.com (news), Jing Dong (e-commerce), Taobao (e-commerce) and Didi (ride-sharing), you will find that they have high information and feature density and highly saturated colors. 
Why is this? This article explores some possible hypotheses about why there is a perceived or actual difference in digital product design.</p>]]></description>

It was in the spotlight especially in 2020, when the pandemic kept us all locked in our homes. In this remote work "Big Bang", we realized that the challenges of teamwork are intensified due to variables that go beyond the project itself. The team is made of people, and people have different routines, habits, and in most cases, different time zones. In addition, each individual has their own background, with strengths and challenges, passing through different moments of their journey.</p>]]></description>

For the longest time, almost 40 years, I wanted to not be here, to escape the pain that being me was causing me. 
Since I can recall being aware of my gender and sexuality, I have felt the pain of not belonging and not being accepted. I have been told I don’t fit in, and that I need to change who I am. I have endured daily aggressions (for a long time not even microaggressions) about who I am in order to be employed, to be loved, and to be part of a family. </p>]]></description>

Many of what we see as tiny specs are, in fact, galaxies, containing stars, which, in turn, may have their own solar systems, planets and satellites. While these galaxies may seem inactive in our lifetime, many activities occur at a macro timescale — stars are born, they collapse, merge; there’s dust in the galaxies; temperatures vary and many other fascinating things.  </p>]]></description>

To identify what quality means for an organisation it is useful to have a manifesto. While Quality Strategy encomapsses quality aspects in software development, Quality Manifesto helps an organisation define what quality means for them strategically. Based on what is set-out in the manifesto, software delivery teams can derive their everyday practices and principles.</p>]]></description>

Naturally, there are also some things that they wish all candidates would simply never do again. Here’s a collection of what recruiters encourage candidates to adopt (as well as what to ditch ASAP) to make a better impression during their recruiting process at Thoughtworks. </p>]]></description>

A new world of work we once imagined would take years — decades — to create has been forced upon us in just a few short months; few anticipate a return to ‘normal’. 
Nimble organizations — those with technology at their core — have the advantage over enterprises hindered by legacy systems, organizations and mindsets. </p>]]></description>

Apple Pay and Google Pay have just announced their partnership. Instead of contactless payments using NFC-enabled devices, many people are using pure biometric-enabled Point of Sales systems. A quick facial scan with voice fingerprint is enough to complete a payment either in store or online. Deciding whether to pay with a credit or debit account has faded into insignificance. Many people have also enabled ‘spend smoothing products’ that adjust a line of credit for all spending and spread bigger purchases over time, based on bills and income variations.</p>]]></description>

You’re a project manager and you want to know the maturity level of the team when it comes to practices that drive quality.
	You’re a test manager on a delivery oriented project and want to figure out the ways to improve the existing quality processes.</p>]]></description>

Organizations have swiftly and successfully embraced remote work with very little preparation. 
For instance, until early this year, nearly everyone on my team worked from the office. Working from home was an available but infrequently leveraged choice. The lockdown changed all that. People travelled to their home towns in remote locations, preferring to stay with families during the crisis. Many, for the first time, experienced an extended period of working from home.</p>]]></description>

Disruptive forces have transformed the payment and credit landscape, accelerating the shift to digital channels. The way we pay today and how we defer payments has changed entirely from where cash was king and credit was granted by the cornershop grocery store. Then everything changed with the introduction of credit cards. However with today’s evolving consumer expectations and more alternative credit providers entering the market, the question is, will credit cards also soon become a thing of the past?</p>]]></description>

In the fitness world, gyms are closed and people are actively looking for alternatives; trying everything from Instagram Live and YouTube workouts, to one-on-one Zoom coaching sessions, to using the great outdoors for walking, running, and biking.

Every organization has more things it wants to do than it can do. This is often viewed as a capacity problem; if only we had more capacity, we could get everything done. However, this is not true. All organizations have a finite capacity and from our experience, there is a law of diminishing returns where adding more and more people to increase capacity is actually counterproductive. In fact, it's how that capacity is allocated that matters.</p>]]></description>

I was an experience designer on these teams managing the user testing, user adoption and design recommendations for feature development across both teams remotely. Parts of my team was in North America, parts in India. Working from home was more or less the norm in this case. But that's not true for everyone.

When you say something is “small” or “easy”; when you say “yes I think we can get that done” or “these are about the same size for flow” or “these are about the same over time”, you are estimating. And even if you aren’t, please remember that for any work that involves expectations, there are stakeholders with questions that need answers, and no one benefits without predictability.

To quote Coco Chanel’s iconic words:
 
You will not have a second chance to make a first impression.

The success of communication with your audience heavily depends on your self-presentation. The audience decides whether they’re into you in the first 30 seconds. Consider the beginning of any talk as a chance to express yourself, make your point, and convince your audience through a well-prepared, confidently delivered, and valuable conversation.</p>]]></description>

The ‘something' can be any quantity - time, volume, weight, etc. The capacity of a machine that makes widgets (or sausages) can be calculated simply by the number of widgets (or sausages) it can make in a specified period of time. In contrast, a person's capacity, in particular our capacity to do useful work, is a little more complicated than that.</p>]]></description>

There are seismic shifts in the way organizations attract, hire, retain and develop top talent. Candidates are taking advantage of the digital age that’s characterized by easy, immediate access to (sometimes) overwhelming information.

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>Git hooks are a feature of git that enable custom scripts to be triggered on certain events during the execution of a git command, such as pre-commit and pre-push. It’s common practice for teams to use git hooks to run quality checks to ensure they are run by all developers every time. While this is a good sign that a team cares about quality and repeatability, I observe that this practice has some major downsides. In this article, I’ll explore why, and what you might do instead.</p>]]></description>

The sweet scent that reminded me of tree sap and freshly mown grass was a good contrast to the exhaust fumes that filled the Xi’an air.

Day 1: We’re walking through customs. The Xi’an airport looks the same as every other airport. The grey-and-white walls, pillars, ceilings, and floor tiles, the nondescript lights and dustbins. Why do the insides of all airports look interchangeable? They’re so culture-mute.</p>]]></description>

- Unknown

Pair programming
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. It is a relatively controversial practice among all of the agile methods, if not the most. In fact, only a few teams that adopt it can actually benefit from it. For the rest, even if they claim they are doing agile, they will often be divided into two camps.</p>]]></description>

Every organization faces a dilemma when it comes to support for programming languages. On the one hand, there’s an understandable desire to standardize — a set of approved languages can help reign in maintenance costs and long term viability. But equally, many of us recognize the benefits of using whichever language the developer feels allows them to express themselves most eloquently.</p>]]></description>

As a senior technology executive at a major bank, she said, she dreamed of data. And not just any data - “data that was structured and not siloed, centralized and not scattered to the four corners of our organization. Data that was available and accessible.”

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>Every year, on the second code Tuesday of October, we celebrate Ada Lovelace Day - an important opportunity to appreciate the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). As an unapologetic feminist, I’ve never needed much of an excuse to celebrate amazing women who’ve been paving the way and shaping the world in which we live. However, over the years, I’ve become disheartened by the predictability of such occasions, which all too often, promote straight, white, cis-gendered women.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>Sitting in my office looking at the people around me, it is hard to imagine working in a world where women aren’t an equal and integral part of the tech environment, yet, there’s still more that needs to be done to make this a normality. With only 14% of the tech workforce identifying as women; a number which has decreased over the last 20 years, what can we do? 
With Ada Lovelace Day approaching, I've been reflecting on her experience as the original women in tech, and what she has done, without even knowing, for future generations. </p>]]></description>

All requests, to and from each of the services go through the mesh. Also known as an infrastructure layer in a microservices setup, the service mesh makes communication between services reliable and secure.  
Each service has its own proxy service (sidecars) and all the proxy services together form the service mesh. The side cars handle communication between services, which means all the traffic goes through the mesh and this transparent layer can now control how services interact. </p>]]></description>

Yes! Great, I also thought I knew, as did a colleague of mine. The problem: each of us had a different interpretation of the meaning. 
As mentioned in my article, visualization and prioritization of technical debt, analogies can significantly help with grasping abstract concepts. This is where a term like “Smoke Testing” can come in handy, as long as everyone involved has the same understanding of the analogy.

Problem solving is one of the most important skills in life and work. At an early age, we learn to deal with simple problems, big and small. From our first wobbly steps, where we solve the problem of balancing on two ridiculously small feet at the end of our limbs, to figuring out the right shaped block to go in the right shaped hole - the round block goes in the round hole, of course, of course! Humans are natural problem solvers. At least when it comes to figuring out how to navigate the physical world.</p>]]></description>

This, in turn, promises to bring about huge changes in consumer behavior — what’s being called “voice commerce”. This is a new channel, governed by a new set of rules. Here, communication is key. 
These shopping assistants use AI and are changing the rules of the game when it comes to customers’ purchasing behavior; they can even make purchasing decisions for the customer if desired.</p>]]></description>

For me, this assumption holds true, as pronouns are an important part of my identity.
Pronouns aren’t just for people like me, they also matter to Sapna, Kerry, Jean, Raj, Mia, Mania, Nikau, Rowan, Kristan - pretty much anyone with a name. Names can need context, especially when you’re working cross-culturally. A good example is the name Jean, which is typically a woman’s name in the UK and a man’s name in France. </p>]]></description>

The way data sharing is done today however, via screen scraping, is neither secure nor legally regulated. In today’s model, a consumer shares their credentials to the recipient organisation, effectively handing over the keys to their financial life. This is where Open Banking comes in. 
In my last post, I looked at the implications of Open Banking on the financial services industry. But what does it mean for consumers? </p>]]></description>

But when studying is no longer a full-time job, my concern is that without a deliberate mindset for learning, sooner or later the appetite and motivation for it fades away.</p>]]></description>

After all, we all exist in a largely homogenous world where cloud, microservices and containers are the cornerstones of today’s leading businesses. In this world of known knowns, even the fiercest of rivals can follow almost identical tech strategies.</p>]]></description>

Risk management is about understanding as much as we can about what we don't know; but knowing enough about what we can conceive or perceive to make informed decisions.
It’s important to suspend judgement and start by simply understanding the catastrophes that may lie in wait for us.</p>]]></description>

There are big changes needed, like lobbying NHS England to include Non-Binary (or X) as a gender marker. These will take time.
We wanted to use our Agile and Lean principles to find ways to address the problems.</p>]]></description>

There are at times however, industry assumptions that older people have less to offer. That technology is a ‘young person’s game’ and as a result, an older person cannot possibly keep up, or worse still, has no interest.</p>]]></description>

I believe that clean code practices apply to the entire team, no matter the role.
Let me tell you why - software development does not really need clean code, and neither does it need agile principles. One can craft perfectly working software without either. But, without either maintaining, modifying and scaling the software becomes incredibly cumbersome.</p>]]></description>

I'm in no way going to use this post to attempt to explain from scratch how TDD works, or how to master it, but instead, look at some key elements of how I apply TDD though real examples.
 
TDD is an iterative approach. Just like say, a living organism evolves and adapts itself to its environment, so too does code – evolving and adapting itself to its tests.</p>]]></description>

After all, most languages today are Turing complete — they can implement everything that is implementable — so what’s the point of learning something new? For self-confessed language geeks like myself — I’d learned five of them before leaving university — that line of argument misses the point. There’s always something interesting and exciting about finding a new language that lets me express myself more clearly.</p>]]></description>

It is a consequence of a decision or an action taken (or inaction) in spite of that uncertainty. Reputational risk, risk of financial losses, business continuity, and failure to evolve are all types of risk which impact organisations today.
In product engineering, risk can be understood as a combination of three things: the severity of the effect of a potential failure, the likelihood or chance of the failure occurring, and the ability to detect the failure (or effect of the failure) if it does occur.</p>]]></description>

Thoughtworks’ Chief Scientist, Martin Fowler has this to say on automation test coverage analysis, “...it helps you find which bits of your code isn't being tested. It's worth running coverage tools every so often and looking at these bits of untested code.” Low automation code coverage definitely affects product quality and puts undue effort on testers to manually test the product.

I didn’t notice any diversity there because there wasn’t any! It was a very white town. I also didn’t notice the amount of privilege I had. Looking back, there are so many things that don’t sit well with me now, particularly some of the attitudes held by my parents.</p>]]></description>

Just three years ago, Charlotte was studying for her Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies at King’s College London,  researching academic practice in Latin America.
So how - and why - did she go from there to being a Consultant Developer at Thoughtworks?
How did you decide to move into coding?</p>]]></description>

Thanks to Docker and a tool called batect, I’ve successfully eliminated this waste on a number of teams.</p>]]></description>

The social enterprise sector in the UK employs approximately one million people, in 70,000 organisations, contributing more than £24 billion to the economy.

We cover tools, techniques, languages, and platforms and we generally call out over one hundred individual ‘blips’.

Technology is evolving faster than humanity is able to keep up with it. There is now a need for rapid, sustained and growing innovation in what the World Economic Forum has dubbed the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The first industrial revolution brought in steam to mechanize power; the second brought in electricity to power mass production, and the third was the dawn of the information era with the rise of the internet.</p>]]></description>

It’s easy to think that success is linked to how much a team knows at the start of a project; however, the potential to develop new skills, learn by doing, and adapt to what is learned is equally, if not more, important. Tackling problems, exploring opportunities and making better decisions comes from a culture that encourages teams to make a learning opportunity out of every action.</p>]]></description>

That matters because tech tends to make quantum leaps, where new and rich environments open up that go far beyond traditional enterprise IT — those that made incumbents successful so far.</p>]]></description>

You may well be one of those people who believe that documentation is a waste of effort because it’s outdated as soon as it’s created. You might believe that your code is self-documenting or that UML diagrams belong in the 90s. But it’s a mistake to think there’s no value in documentation.</p>]]></description>

If that’s not intimidating enough, imagine that the rules are in constant flux and new players can join the simul without any warning. This is similar to some of the experiences that business leaders go through today.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>We software developers have historically used the terms “frontend” and “backend” to describe work on client-side (e.g., browser) and server-side applications, respectively. This conceptual split has evolved into the creation of specialized developer roles for each, which is still the norm throughout the industry. In practice, this is an arbitrary split that is too often used to avoid work we don’t want to do. It creates team dynamics that make it unnecessarily difficult to integrate client and server-side functionality and deliver quality software.</p>]]></description>

It’s not about just reorganizing workgroups or renaming meetings. Agility is a mindset — a culture that depends on each and every one of us. It’s the belief that each person can contribute unique value to a project. This is challenging — many of us aren’t used to the level of ownership, collaboration, flexibility and disruptive thinking that Agile demands.</p>]]></description>

The challenge of ensuring a truly diverse workforce, therefore, is to reach out further and deeper beyond the evolving circle of ‘normal’ and seek out the ‘minorities in diversity.’ This entails challenging the working definition of diversity; questioning whether the boxes we tick on recruitment forms (gender, race, age, etc.) really cover the various forms of diversities that exist; assessing our recruitment models to see if we are inadvertently filtering out worthy candidates.</p>]]></description>

Others are frustrated, and I’m concerned we may to lose them.

Every break or sharp turn to avoid plunging off a cliff would become a point needing your input. This top-down oversight might work if the bus was on a straight road with wide lanes, little traffic, and clear conditions, but what a failed strategy this would be for a crowded, twisting road with unexpected obstacles.</p>]]></description>

They typically support knowledge-intensive processes, back office, and IT operations. The GIC phenomenon began on the basis of labor arbitrage and grew on the back of talent quality and availability, primarily in India and China but also in Romania, the Philippines, and Ireland. On the other hand, the business environment has changed significantly since the time GICs were conceived at parent headquarters.</p>]]></description>

When people talk about Lean, the conversation often ends at process optimization, waste, and quality, and misses so much of what the Lean mindset offers.
Design Thinking is held high as the new magic trick of design facilitators.</p>]]></description>

A good retrospective strengthens the team and creates a spirit of shared identity. Typically, retrospectives are held within a delivery team or a small team working on a specific topic. But sometimes, you have to run a retrospective session with larger teams — for instance, a whole project team that consists of multiple delivery teams.</p>]]></description>

This approach will be inadequate when faced with complex regulations, nested organizational structures and sophisticated fraud patterns.  Compliance organizations are currently spending 90% of their time collecting and massaging information and only 10% reacting to events and crafting policies.</p>]]></description>

But you can’t achieve this lofty goal in the solitude of a designer’s ivory tower. Great customer experiences need the business to do the heavy lifting for the customers. Which in turn requires a myriad of capabilities, processes, and systems. Crafting great customer experiences requires designers to get out and embrace these organizational complexities.</p>]]></description>

The pace of change makes it more difficult than ever for retailers to forecast accurately. Today’s retailers don’t know tomorrow's customers expect. The only certainty is that an attractive product range alone isn’t a competitive advantage anymore; consumers have an almost endless choice of alternative vendors.</p>]]></description>

Women in tech is a hot topic, as it well should be.

The coffee giant’s pre-order app was meant to make it easier for customers. It should have meant the customer could place their order well while on the go, swoop into the store and head straight past the queues to the collection point, and get on their way in a matter of minutes. Instead, customers walked into stores ill-prepared for these sudden spikes in demand.</p>]]></description>

Increasingly, there is a need to reinvent themselves and align better with the business. The industry is at crossroads, where they need to choose between being merely seen as a cost center in the organization, and instead, take the lead to be an important and influential partner in the business.
At Thoughtworks, we have been thinking a lot about the direction that the IT team needs to take. In the last 4-5 years, we have been continuously challenging ourselves and evolving along with our changing business.  </p>]]></description>

These are not automation tools. Nor is it technical advice.</p>]]></description>

The standard of always on, which caused a great shift in social and workforce dynamics, is a remnant of the desktop and Blackberry era. 10 years ago, we had Wikipedia and started to say “just Google it”. Over time, that technology led us to develop cultural expectations of responding to that 9PM email. We brought this expectation with us as smartphones debuted and evolved, but something dramatic happened when the concept of ‘mobile first’ started to become a reality.</p>]]></description>

Aircraft today are sophisticated digital and mechanical systems. Despite leaps and bounds in progress, they still break. And that’s hardly a surprise. Planes cart passengers to all corners of the earth in a complex world of extreme heat, cold and turbulence.</p>]]></description>

Sometimes these events are instantly recognized as historic turning points, other times recognition comes slowly. One such slowly evolving inflection point began in the early 2000’s and has accelerated in the last 5 years—the transition from a cost-driven view of IT to one that is value-driven. We could also characterize this inflection point as changing focus from efficiency to responsiveness.</p>]]></description>

It was something that I now realize started way back in my internship during college. Being a Tech Lead is something that you grow into, often because other leaders gave you a safe space to practice leadership, and you observed them and learned from them.</p>]]></description>

However, placing the decision-making authority of cloud purchases solely in the infrastructure department often achieves incremental efficiencies at the cost of long-term business results. The greatest benefit of these technologies comes from the organizational changes they allow.</p>]]></description>

This pattern makes sense, too: in an age where a single developer can spin up a globally-distributed infrastructure for an application with a few dollars and a few API calls, the gap between development and systems administration is closer than ever. While I’ve seen plenty of blog posts and articles about cool DevOps tools to use and thoughts to think about, I’ve seen fewer content on pointers and suggestions for people looking to get into this field.</p>]]></description>

It’s a word used to signal to a company that there’s an intent to make a change. Often predicated on a new executive hire or a poor performance year, it’s the war cry for “we have to do something different, and fast”. The next step is usually to call in your favorite premium consultancy and then sit back as they roll out the kit-bag of recommendations that inevitably never get completed or don't fit with the culture of the company. All strategy, no execution.</p>]]></description>

This has been frustrating because using CM tools to provision infrastructure undoubtedly leads to complex code that is unmaintainable and hard to extend.
Let’s take a look at the downfalls of misusing CM tools for provisioning and how provisioning tools are more equipped for this purpose.

You have an idea, maybe even a great one. You’ve done your design sprint, your visioning session, your intense few days of white-boarding.

I was hired by a small firm after interviewing with its general director and financial director, all in one sitting, and after completing a timed one-hour programming exercise. Hearing the general director say “see you on Monday, then” was satisfying to say the least.</p>]]></description>

Traditionally neural networks are trained using the backpropagation algorithm. Back propagation is limited in its application especially in scenarios where a training set of sufficient size is unavailable as in artificial life or evolutionary robotics. Backpropagation also puts a lot of constraints on the topology of the network.</p>]]></description>

We have all heard the stories of QAs who ring bells when they find defects, and we are not surprised when developers on those teams are scared of (or annoyed by) interacting with them. In contrast, teams that truly believe everyone brings unique skills to the table and are working together towards the same goal are far more effective. And most importantly, the end result is higher quality software.</p>]]></description>

You need to adjust the way you work and find a different rhythm.
This transition can be difficult to make as it’s often about subtle differences rather than a complete change of job. You’re still solving the same problems and doing the same tasks. The difference is in the way you structure your workflow.</p>]]></description>

In fact, in the early days of Agile adoption, some purists believed that Agility and Distributed Development could not coexist, going by this principle - “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is via face-to-face conversation”. Distributed Development is a reality today and in most cases, a necessity due to some very convincing reasons.</p>]]></description>

Doing this induces anxiety, even among seasoned professionals. In most organisations—where failure is not an option—leaders have many fears. They fear what they do not know. They fear that competitors will outpace them. Most of all, they fear their inability to find success. This fear causes rational leaders with no permission to fail to resort to conservatism.</p>]]></description>

What is shameful is not just the mob's targeting of the African students for an accident at the same spot earlier on, that they were completely unconnected with, but also the complicity of the police personnel present there and other bystanders. It is a sad commentary on the administration, that it took three days and public outrage to register a police complaint and take action.</p>]]></description>

Mobile Test Automation is increasingly becoming very important. Almost all web applications are responsive these days and it's very important to test how the application works across devices. The same is true with the native application as well. At the same time, the number of devices and the custom OS versions on devices are also vast. This means that it's harder for a tester to manually run the automated tests over a list of devices to get device coverage and quicker results over every feature development.</p>]]></description>

In fact, some of the habits of a developer can do more harm than good, when not applied well and with more authority in this new role.</p>]]></description>

My super power is not being one thing, but many things. I am an example of the new fluid careerist. What’s a fluid career? It’s a way through life that leverages a collection of experiences, expertise, roles/titles and spans multiple industries. Fluid careerists navigate ambiguity and are nimble. We’re restlessly driven by curiosity, have a passionate need for excellence and aspire to self-awareness.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>It can often be difficult to devise an appropriate strategy when it comes to testing on browsers and devices. Exhaustive testing of all browser/device combinations is an exercise in futility; we must consider a smarter and more realistic approach. Using user data to drive your strategy will help you to focus your efforts ‘where they are needed most’, while adopting a risk-based attitude to coverage and defects will help you prioritize ‘what really matters’.</p>]]></description>

Many people are aware of the power of feedback, but they are also aware of the difficulty in giving it. As children we are educated in "right and wrong" and but giving feedback is not so easy because it's not something that is taught.</p>]]></description>

How long does it take your organization to get ideas to market? For organizations using a traditional workflow, new ideas can take as long as 18 to 24 months—or more—to get into a customer’s hands.</p>]]></description>

Some executives, especially those in large enterprises full of hierarchy, rules and rigid structure, feel the need to follow this dangerously linear way of thinking as a means to justify change. Consultants use this as a way to dress up old rope and sell it for new prices.</p>]]></description>

James Michener was a better writer than Ernest Hemingway because he could type 20 words-per-minute faster.
Makes sense—right? 
Assessing the effectiveness of writers based on productivity measures makes absolutely no sense.
If your job is to write code “words” rather than English (or French or Spanish) words, judging your work based on productivity makes no more sense.</p>]]></description>

I was surprised how popular the 22 rules of UX (adapted from Pixar’s 22 rules of storytelling) has been.

I was trying to figure it out — why do great stories make for great experiences? How do they play a part in the way we shape experiences and tackle design problems ?</p>]]></description>

There are multiple factors that affect user behavior. As a user researcher, you need to read and understand your user’s body language, and know where it is appropriate to probe and when. How is this research impacted when it’s not possible to be physically located with your test audience? With the rapid pace of innovation and increasingly global focus of organizations, how can we adapt our approach?</p>]]></description>

On my 5th birthday, my parents gave me my first food stamp and said “Boy, you’re old enough to go and buy soy sauce”. This might seem trivial, but in China it was a big deal—a coming of age of sorts.
 
There’s a lot to learn from China’s speedy retail revolution. From the food stamps of the '80s to the mega lifestyle centers of today, retail trends that manifested over hundreds of years in the western world unfolded in China in a much shorter time period.</p>]]></description>

Those who make this statement, often those selling something, usually claim what data science needs most of all is better tools for doing these so called data munging tasks to free up data scientists to concentrate on what they’re best at.

It is carried out in addition to the delivery role (e.g. developer, business analyst, etc.) being played on a project.</p>]]></description>

Chances are the answer is yes. Everyone has a great idea up their sleeve. But not everyone has made millions of dollars from them.

Chances are if you’re creative, energized by change, and excited by the unexplored, neither do you. If there’s one thing I learned in five years of PhD research of artists and their values, it’s this. Money is nice. Psychic Income is better.  
There’s a lot to be done to bring this new currency of work out of the artist’s studio and into the places we work.  </p>]]></description>

While interacting with a few African students in India, we came to know about the African Students Association in Telangana State (ASA-TS). There are many such student bodies in other cities in India and across the world. Such social settings are important platforms to unite African students (outside of Africa) into one strong community.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>The key objectives of Organizations is to provide / derive value from the products / services they offer. To achieve this, they need to be able to deliver their offerings in the quickest time possible, and of good quality!
In such a fast moving environment, CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery) are now a necessity and not a luxury!
There are various practices that Organizations and Enterprises need to implement to enable CD. Testing (automation) is one of the important practices that needs to be setup correctly for CD to be successful.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>Enterprises of all sizes have confused novelty for innovation.  Innovation institutes change: changing the offering, changing expectations, even (for the lucky few) changing the game. Novelty’s only benefit is its newness; like the smell of a new car, it rarely survives extended contact with its first customers. 
 

The pressures of the changing market have compounded that confusion with the desire to do anything, instead of the right thing. In the arms race for what’s-new, too often innovation at scale becomes a synonym for “expensive diversion.”</p>]]></description>

We need to stop wasting so much time. We have a well-deserved reputation for retreating to creative studios for lengthy design phases - only choosing to resurface once we have perfected solutions that are pretty, but not necessarily practical. We need to end the pursuit of design perfection and focus on delivering value faster. We need to embrace the Lean movement and streamline the way we work.</p>]]></description>

The most widespread technology for securing communication is called Transport Layer Security (TLS (previously known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)). This technology is not as widely deployed as it should be, since it can be complicated to set up correctly. But even when set up correctly there are many issues with TLS that make it unsuitable for the long run.</p>]]></description>

Businesses have let themselves slip into a mass-market definition of loyalty that isn’t pretty. We foster fear and pander to greed all the while pretending its love.  
Deeply disruptive changes are on the horizon that will make this shallow engagement obsolete. Fortunately, these same forces offer a new path for building individual relationships that merit something closer to true loyalty.

Agile practices encourage in-person interactions to foster collaboration, whereas, distributed and large teams force communication into the opposite direction.  Therefore, it is important to achieve agility albeit with different, or modified mechanics, that work well for distributed and large team.</p>]]></description>

It’s difficult for many reasons. Defining a strategy is not a static exercise. Predicting the future is difficult, full of uncertainty, and new information is always being discovered. Complicating things further, teams often divide responsibility for strategy and execution. This makes it harder to adapt to new information.</p>]]></description>

As you solve one problem, however, another is quickly there ready to take its place. Soon the number of problems grows beyond your capacity to handle them all in a timely fashion, and a queue of problems emerges ready for your sage advice that no one else seems able to offer.</p>]]></description>

Most think of it as an arduous drag involving looking through piles of logs and stack traces, and taking random guesses. And that was exactly what I believed before actually experiencing it myself in a project. It taught me a lot and changed my perspective towards software development and collaboration with other teams.</p>]]></description>

I used to doodle everywhere. All the rear pages of my books used to be messy with my drawings.  Our education system focuses mostly on getting the best out of the students by drilling down their heads and asking them to study hard. A typical career aspiration of parents is to see their kids become an engineer, doctor, CA but not an artist, musician, or farmer. Teachers who guide us towards our career path also were not happy with my hobby of doodling. They did not want me to ruin my career just by being an artist!</p>]]></description>

We all get great ideas. Some ideas work, while others don’t. Have you wondered why those ideas don’t work? Based on my experience, a good number of my ideas didn’t work because I was unable to sell them to the intended audience. I was unable to convince them, or perhaps I tried the wrong approach in telling them that this was a great idea. I went to the extent of becoming judgemental towards those who didn’t accept my ideas. Have you experienced something similar, when you feel your ideas aren’t working out the way you want them to?</p>]]></description>

Whenever this happens, he will fiddle with his tests until he achieves the glorious 100% statistic - after which he will have earned not only bragging rights (shudder!), but also the approval of upper management. But let’s take a step back and examine this situation. Does a 100% test coverage result mean that we have achieved testing perfection? The answer may baffle you.</p>]]></description>

In other words, any concept that might be the target of an author's hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a resource.</p>]]></description>

As projects grow in scale, traditional development teams grow each of these phases without changing the sequence or frequency. Each phase happens once and only after the previous one is completed. This model has worked for generations for building physical goods and people just assumed it would work for software as well. It didn’t.</p>]]></description>

I've been working as an Agile QA for a while and I would like to share my point of view about how QAs work in an agile team. In this article, I will use the term QA to represent an "Agile Tester".
Most people, even in agile teams, treat QAs as a sub-role or a separate role in the team. I believe this is an outdated conception. The difference between a QA and a Dev lies in the mindset.</p>]]></description>

In the mid-1990s, I managed an enterprise data model project for an apparel company. This initiative had a checkered history of complex technical solutions and limited implementation support. Our primary success criteria was, therefore, garnering management support and funding for implementation.</p>]]></description>

For some, it’s a lot more than the others. As we find new ways for technology to enhance our lives and businesses, we also accumulate multiple types of physical devices and media to access technology. Newer and updated versions of existing products enter the market every few months and the fast pace of evolving products has meant that users keep buying technologies without evaluating if they really need it.</p>]]></description>

The DRIP Bill authorises blanket communications data retention which the European Court of Justice found in April to violate the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The Court stated that data retention was a "serious interference with … the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data". </p>]]></description>

The premise of lean development is that we should write the minimal amount of code to satisfy our goals. A way to ensure that code is able to solve the given problem and respond to change over time is to articulate the problem in machine-readable form. This allows us to programmatically validate its correctness. For this reason, xDD is mainly used by testing frameworks to set the context. A framework as a series of tests runs goals, as well as the code to fulfill them.</p>]]></description>

If you’re afflicted with Imposter Syndrome, as 70% of successful people are, you might feel like a fraud because your accomplishments are inadequate. Many people with Imposter Syndrome attribute their success to luck or timing, instead of their own hard work. They report “waiting to be found out.”

Ironically, imposters are the ones who are most likely to be high achievers.</p>]]></description>

Most of the interesting cafes, bars and shops are mysteries wrapped in alleys, wrapped in narrow passageways. But how to find these hidden gems?</p>]]></description>

Now I know a number of developers who would cringe at the mere mention of Internet Explorer (IE).

If you want to go far, go together.” It’s a great mindset with regard to software design and development - we should always encourage a joint working environment.
One way to “go together” is through workshops. We do it a lot at Thoughtworks - whether it’s to kickoff a Discovery phase around developing new product propositions or initiating a new phase of work in what we call an “inception”. But setting up and running a workshop, of any flavor, is not easy.</p>]]></description>

Local optimization is something we do in everyday life. I would rather not have garbage on my doorstep, but its alright if its on my neighbor’s, which still makes the neighborhood, and the city, stink.</p>]]></description>

You recognize it as unfair, wrong — not just because it's illegal, but because access is a basic human right.
We don't think about the Web this way. We should. These same people with disabilities — people who use keyboards for navigation, people who use screen readers, are suffering through a substandard or even completely non-functional experience.</p>]]></description>

A good Inception practitioner should always be thinking about improving the methodology.

Though there were strong agreements and disagreements all along the way, one thing stood out to me all the way - there is no right or wrong answer. The answer depends on the context. There are various parameters and considerations to be examined to determine what answer you come up with.</p>]]></description>

Some people don’t feel comfortable enough to give an honest opinion and limit themselves to giving positive feedback. Others will only observe the negatives. And most folks base their critique on their own biased aesthetic viewpoint rather than focusing on the purpose of the design (form follows function, remember?). These and a number of other reasons can turn a design critique session into an endless back-and-forth conversation.
Enter Six Thinking Hats….</p>]]></description>

People think of cost and time.  Think about the last time a mechanic fixed your car or you hired a painter to put a fresh coat of paint on the third floor windows.  You are thinking about time and cost aren't you?  When we start thinking about a software project we are still estimating the cost and time, but of the project not the stories.  We are doing ourselves a disservice when we say we estimate our stories.</p>]]></description>

Does the concept and practice exist only in development and DevOps? If not, then what do analysts have to do with it?


To answer these questions, let's first think about what Continuous Delivery represents: it is about building quality right into your product or application; it is about enabling more frequent and reliable releases, shrinking the ceremonial aspects of releasing to the production environment to the point where you are always ready to release quality software that is fit for purpose.</p>]]></description>

It is a good idea to focus on the person who will be using whatever it is you are making. UX should be an insurance to minimise the fail rate of your product by telling you what will fail before you finish building it.
If you still don't have a UX designer on your team, stop reading and get one! For the rest of us, your project's risk might not be on the UX insurance coverage just yet if it's displaying one of these four symptoms.

The tech stack was a Drupal with lots of PHP to customize the CMS with Java based Selenium 1.0 tests on the side. It was not created to test the app comprehensively, and there were gaping holes. The Selenium 1.0 suite consisted of a few UI-driven tests representing user interactions. They took 100 minutes to run and did not even discover critical failures.

Here is how I approached this problem and the lessons I learned along the way.</p>]]></description>

One of the things that impressed me about that project was the way we went about planning. This included an approach to estimating which was both lightweight yet more effective than what I'd seen before. Over a decade has now passed, and now there is an argument amongst experienced agilsts about whether estimation is worth doing at all, or indeed is actively harmful.</p>]]></description>

One of my goals was to find out how Thoughtworks can be so different from other IT and software development companies, yet still be able to maintain a very successful business. The purpose of this blog is to answer that question. I will, as briefly as possible, describe how I arrived at my conclusion.</p>]]></description>

Well-known bank has to replace your cash card. They don’t schedule the delivery, despite giving clear instructions repeatedly to the customer support representative. Thus you miss the delivery and have to make a fresh request that takes 4 working days to process. You then try the IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system to change the PIN. After entering all your personal information, card information, details of your favorite color, childhood sweetheart and grandmother’s maiden name, the IVR pushes you back to Customer Support.</p>]]></description>

In 1958, the average years a company stayed in the Standard and Poor’s 500 list was 61 years. In 1980, it was down to 25 years, and by 2004, it was 18 years. Now, a company enters or exits the list every 2 weeks. 75% will be replaced within 15 years1.</p>]]></description>

Much like “distributed” seems to be contrary to “Agile”, “scale” also fits in rather uncomfortably with “Agile”. The SAFe framework has its fair share of criticism, but what are the alternatives? Who better to inject some fresh perspective in than Johanna Rothman - the “Pragmatic Manager”?</p>]]></description>

But keeping a project on-track in terms of enhanced user experience goes beyond just hitting that next release deadline: it’s also about adding value to the business and building features that matter to end users. It’s also important not forget the UX debt we may have built up thanks to shoddy software practices.</p>]]></description>

Recording sessions on desktops is easy. Applications like Morae or Silverback have been allowing us to do screen captures with a picture-in-picture window of a participant’s face for years now. They simply use the mouse pointer and webcams to capture of full picture of what the user is doing.</p>]]></description>

At the minimum on both iOS and Android, as they have the bulk of the mobile/tablet market share. Thus being able to test your mobile applications on both iOS and Android is a must, no arguments there. However, having to maintain multiple test implementations, switching the driver selection from one to another, and doing a bunch of configuration can be irritating at best and error-prone at worst.</p>]]></description>

Businesses have always come and gone, but these days it seems that companies can fall from market dominance to bankruptcy in the blink of an eye. Kodak, Blockbuster and HMV are just a few recent victims of the rapid market disruption that defines the current era.
Where did these once iconic companies go wrong? To my mind, they forgot to keep challenging their assumptions about what business they were actually in.</p>]]></description>

The answer is obvious - "it depends." Despite having one of the clearest definitions amongst recent buzzwords, there are many types of clouds and many ways to integrate them with your application or development processes. If you have an experienced team that can make informed choices, then these options are a great thing for quality. The team can take advantage of the cloud as a tool to assure quality, rather than viewing it as an extra aspect that needs to be tested.</p>]]></description>

I'll use the metaphor of the after work drinks, since I'm most familiar with that one. What often happens is something like the following:

Thirsty worker #1: "I'll send an email to everyone asking who wants to go to the pub after work"

Thirsty workers #2 to #6 all reply that they do.

Thirsty worker #7 says, "I just need to finish a few things off. Can you wait 5 minutes?”</p>]]></description>

A core XP practice and one of TDD's pillars, constant refactoring keeps the evil design upfront at bay and maintain our codebases in a healthy state. One of the few things I think most developers agree on is that refactorings are helpful and should be done at some point in any project, preferably in a continuous manner.</p>]]></description>

<title>Don’t be misled by your A/B testing - Part 1</title>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>Isn’t A/B testing just “40% is better than 30%”?
You have a product and want to encourage more people to complete a specific task. You have 2 ideas, you decide to A/B test them to see which is better. So, you put your users into two groups (A and B) where each group sees a different solution, and then measure which group is more successful at completing the task. After 200 total tests, 30 out of 100 people in Group A completed the task, while 40 out of 100 people in Group B completed the task.
The answer is obvious: B is better than A, right?
Not necessarily.</p>]]></description>

What could be better than getting together for an evening, or a weekend, with food, friends, maybe a beer, and using one’s magic powers to create a piece of technology that saves the world?
I exaggerate. Most people don’t think they’ll save the world in a weekend, but sometimes they act as if they believe they can.
As software professionals, when was the last time we went to our bosses and said “No problem. I’ll build that brand new production system for you in 8-16hrs”? Probably never.</p>]]></description>

However, though there are a lot of tools to help you implement CD, it is no simple task. In this post I'll walk you through how the team I’m on is implementing CD using automation as the first step to our goal.</p>]]></description>

This may have many causes, but one often overlooked one, is that stories tend to get “inflated” as day-to-day pressures start to mount. I am not speaking about point estimates, but the story scope itself. Trying to do too much in a story compromises flow, increase cycle time and can frustrate the team. An agile team that strives for continuous and interactive delivery should try and revert that tendency.</p>]]></description>

Do you hear this on your project? Are your tests flaky? Does the build change from green to red and back again without any real explanation? What are you doing about it?

Recently I joined a project that had this problem. It's quite normal to encounter it and it's quite common to get around it by just running the test again. Some teams had actually added scripts to pick up failed tests and run them again automatically at the end of the same build, in case they pass the second time around.</p>]]></description>

We often hear of teams saying that their project is using BDD, but when we check it out, it turns out to be using only a BDD tool for test automation - and not the BDD concepts itself. So in the end, we hear people arguing about the tools, and not about the ideas that inspired the creation of those tools.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>The phrase, “we hire really talented people,” is the same line given by any software company these days who is serious about producing great software. I have seen, firsthand, that talent does not necessarily have an Ivy League background or a 4.0 GPA.

Creativity and innovation is fostered in an environment where people are able to be their authentic selves, work in a culture that is a “safe place” for everyone, are collaborative, are transparent and that gives people the freedom to make mistakes in the pursuit of “getting it right.”</p>]]></description>

Programming involves solving problems by thinking abstractly about quantity, relationship and behaviour. As a programmer I have to either come up with a new algorithm or customise an existing one for the current problem and optimise it.  The formal methods of thinking that mathematics demands — careful reasoning, searching for counter-examples, spotting connections between concepts are some of the essential things needed in programming as well.</p>]]></description>

Agile methods are becoming increasingly common in application design, with their collaborative customer focus and iterative, test driven approach. They share many common principles, yet it is rare for Agile methods to incorporate user centred design. This article argues that by incorporating user-centred design (and in particular using low fidelity prototyping as an iterative model for the application rather than time consuming code) better applications can be developed, delivering business benefit with a focus upon the end user and their experience.</p>]]></description>

Forward-thinking retailers are responding by opening convenience stores much more aggressively, and by investing in infrastructure and new online offerings.
For example, building on its strategy to drive efficiencies throughout all areas of its business, the UK supermarket chain Morrisons is getting fit for the future by moving from systems rooted in the 1980s.</p>]]></description>

We recently conducted an internal workshop on design thinking and customer discovery for a group of our junior consultants. The workshop began with this assignment: "Go out into the world and find a problem. When you come back, we'll try to solve it." It was interesting to see the problems that were identified and explored and exciting to watch the groups use design thinking (a totally new topic for many) to try to solve those problems. Below are the key take-aways from our workshop--these are good general guidelines for anyone to follow when approaching problem solving. We hope these guidelines help you (or at least inspire you to conjure Vanilla Ice, "If there is a problem, yo...I'll solve it"). Feel free to comment on this post if you think we missed some!</p>]]></description>

Mention “Big Data” or “Analytics” and pat comes the reply: Hadoop! Hadoop, however, was purpose-built for a clear set of problems; for some it is, at best, a poor fit and others, even worse, a mistake. While data transformation (or, broadly, ETL operations) benefit significantly from a Hadoop setup, if your business needs fall into any of the following five categories, Hadoop might be a misfit.</p>]]></description>

By asking the right questions, you will be led to the right data that actually makes a difference in your business.</p>]]></description>

In a scientific context, this means stating hypotheses and seeking to disprove them using quantitative analysis of real data in rapid cycles.  The end result is actionable insight and maximized value to stakeholders. This article is the first in a series where we paint a picture of a Thoughtworks analytics engagement. We'll focus here on the concept of the data lab, where a data science team explores data, hypotheses, and quantitative methodologies to answer core business questions with advanced analytics.
A Picture of an Agile Analytics Engagement
Advanced analytics is an umbrella term that covers a wide swath of tools and techniques, all rooted in rigorous statistics. A data science team is not only able to solve IT problems, but can answer any quantitative question that is at the heart of a business. When visualizing metrics means you can better monitor the health of your business processes and capital, we can design and build out effective, tailored dashboard reporting tools. When you want deeper insight on what drives value for your shareholders, we can analyze a far wider variety of data sources than is typically used in traditional business intelligence. And when you want to increase revenue with targeted recommendations and personalization, we bring expertise in sophisticated machine learning techniques to the table. Wherever it is possible to answer valuable business questions with real data, there is an opportunity to engage a data science team.
So how might an agile analytics engagement unfold?  The following picture illustrates a model for applying agile methodologies to data science analytics.</p>]]></description>

They were the captains of the "mission critical" applications. Today, with the vast array of niche service providers and the proliferation of Cloud and SaaS, the choreographed ERP ecosystems of yesterday are becoming “old school.” Marketing departments in particular are at the forefront of this change.</p>]]></description>

Successful retailers are the ones that are focusing their IT spend on customer-facing initiatives. Differentiation is no longer happening from investment in back-end systems. A strong customer-facing strategy is now an imperative for retail market leadership.</p>]]></description>

People arguably spend as much time analyzing test failures as they do writing tests. This necessitates good functional test reports. A good functional test should not merely report where your test failed. It should give you all the information necessary to be able to make your analysis.</p>]]></description>

Developers using the Microsoft technology stack have adopted NuGet as a primary dependency manager. NuGet provides a clean way to acquire interesting reusable components from a reliable public source, stay up to date with new versions of the components (or not), and even use your own NuGet private NuGet repository internally.
 
One of Go’s strengths is its extensibility. Almost anything that can be run from a command line can be integrated into a Go pipeline and value stream.</p>]]></description>

We treat all our virtual servers as immutable. When we upgrade our system we create brand new servers and destroy the old ones, rather than upgrading them in-place. This is a logical extension of the phoenix server approach in which servers are regularly recreated from scratch. Our adoption of immutable servers was inspired by an anecdote that when physical servers play up in Google’s data centers they are pulled out of the racks and discarded rather than fixed.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>Many new media design, advertising and games development agencies struggle to factor in graphic and experience design effectively into their agile software development methodologies.
Abstract
Nowadays, it is hard to justify a large part of a project’s design budget on three months creative direction, where screens of every potential stage of an application are mocked up before development even begins. Clients now see the risk in spending too much early on in the project as it leaves very little time and budget to incorporate important changes later on in the project.</p>]]></description>

I expected that frequent deployments, tons of automation and lots of learning about Amazon’s AWS would come with the territory - and it did. What I didn’t expect was that I’d end up asking and answering so many questions dealing with when feature X or bug fix Y would be ready for testing and when it would be ready to be promoted to production.</p>]]></description>

Frankly I’ve had a few identity crisis since I started working as an analyst on agile teams in 2006. </p>]]></description>

I’m a big advocate of that approach. Let me explain why.
I'm an estimation geek who loves the nuances of estimation, and have used function points, use case points, COCOMO, and story points for over 10 years. Over time, I’ve become convinced that the more we estimate past the very initial point, the less accurate we get. Additionally, long-drawn, “scientific” estimation exercises generate wrong expectations of certainty.</p>]]></description>

Reviewing a nice big stack of well-rendered mockups created in a high-end graphic design program can give stakeholders that feeling that whatever comes out the other end of the production pipeline in 6 months, it is going to be ready for customers to use and return on investment. The reality is that most of the time, 3 months past the release deadline, the design is outdated and the business has changed enough to make most of the design irrelevant.</p>]]></description>

We then had to follow it up with frequent releases and be done with the minimum viable product (MVP) in 8 weeks. After the MVP we had to incorporate feedback and the store’s backend needs. We signed up for all of this and more in a Lean Startup style gig.</p>]]></description>

This is the first part in a series of blogs discussing our learning.
One of the great things about the cloud is the way you can just run a bit of code or a bash script and before a Windows admin can open their GUI you’ve got a running box. This opens up a host of opportunities and new patterns. Martin Fowler recently posted about the Phoenix Server pattern where machines are simply thrown away rather than upgraded. But these things require looking at the way you architect infrastructure slightly differently.</p>]]></description>

It’s a familiarity thing, and it’s a trust thing. We’re not saying that the people who get promoted are stars during every “crucible” moment at the office, but at least they’re present and accounted for. And their presence says: Work is my top priority. I’m committed to this company. I want to lead. And I can.
- Jack and Suzie Welch in a 2007 Business Week column 

After all the hullabaloo about Yahoo eliminating its work from home policy I thought a lot about how distributed work is part of everyday life on many Thoughtworks teams. It’s certainly true for our Mingle team where we have a pair of great developers who are based in the UK while the rest of the team is based in San Francisco.</p>]]></description>

In Go terminology, C1 has one upstream dependency d1 while C2 has two upstream dependencies d2 and d3.</p>]]></description>

The quicker you can find out if a change breaks something the better off you are and the more confidence you will have in your software. We tell the teams who want to go faster that they need to fail fast. We built Go to give teams the power to model and remodel a Build-Test- Release workflow so that they get super quick feedback on every change. And if something breaks, great, find it fast, fix it fast, and then run the new version through the gauntlet.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>When you start out with your project, it would have been sufficient for you to push your application out to a single environment. You may have called it development or staging and deployed every build that passed your tests onto it. However, soon enough, as your application grows, there is typically a need for multiple environments between the first one and what you may call production. At the very least, you will need to have a staging and a production environment, if not more (UAT, QA?).

I have seen both top-down and bottom-up adoptions, and both have their advantages and disadvantages. But in either scenario, most of the energy goes into making sure the technical folks (developers, analysts, testers, operations, etc.), yet we tend to pay little or no attention to the leaders of the organization, especially at the executive level. Yet these are the very people who can encourage and embrace the agile adoption, or reject it. I see a gap here, don’t you?</p>]]></description>

Let’s be clear. I am proud of my career in software sales leadership. I am also proud that as a team we (Thoughtworks Studios Sales) focus on trying to do the right thing for our customers. But over recent years I have become increasingly aware of two things:
Market changes mean that for a sales team, doing the right thing for the customer is different today than in the past,

I get a lot of push back on this – especially when doing Mingle implementations. People inevitably start down the “Access control” route.
“So I should make it so only QA’s can move a card to done! Right?”
Wrong! I think so anyway – It is true that the QA should be the only person actually exercising this change, but don’t restrict it because you then create critical dependencies on someone in that group!</p>]]></description>

If I were to ask a developer or a QA to write a scenario, I can rest assured that it will be an Imperative style whereas a BA or an end user would probably adopt a declarative style. There is no, one is better than the other, both styles have their advantages and disadvantages. This article talks about achieving a middle ground to reap the benefits of both styles.</p>]]></description>

This latter case is common. You might have a short lived branch and a long lived mainline. Using templates here is better than cloning the mainline pipeline because any future change to the template will automatically get reflected in both mainline and branch.</p>]]></description>

The absorption of a lexicon takes time and patience.  Twist can help keep this task achievable for consumers of acceptance tests by allowing the definition of confirmation language to be natural.

If that is not the case, I would suggest using a pure code test framework such as TestNG to achieve the technical benefits of the Twist runner design.</p>]]></description>

By assigning an agent to an environment, it will be used to run only those jobs that belong to the pipelines of that environment. An agent can belong to more than one environment but a pipeline can only belong to a single environment. Once an agent is associated with one or more environments, it is no longer capable of picking up jobs on pipelines that do not belong to environments. Pipelines outside of environments will only be assigned to agents in the default pool (not associated with any environment).</p>]]></description>

<title>Why is test automation the backbone of Continuous Delivery?</title>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>Software testing and verification needs a careful and diligent process of impersonating an end user, trying various usages and input scenarios, comparing and asserting expected behaviours. Directly, the words "careful and diligent" invoke the idea of letting a computer program do the job. Automating certain programmable aspects of your test suite thus can help software delivery massively. In most of the projects that I have worked on, there were aspects of testing which could be automated, and then there were some that couldn't. Nonetheless, my teams could rely heavily on our automation suite when we had one, and spend our energies testing aspects of the application we could not cover with automated functional tests. Also, automating tests helped us immensely to meet customer demands for quick changes, and subsequently reaching a stage where every build, even ones with very small changes went out tested and verified from our stable. As Jez rightly says in his excellent text about Continuous Delivery, automated tests "take delivery teams beyond basic continuous integration" and on to the path of continuous delivery.</p>]]></description>

Automated functional testing ensures that your software is working across your value stream and that your organization has fast feedback when it's not. Maintaining automated acceptance tests, once a team has more than a few tests, isn't trivial however. This webinar covers best practices for keeping your functional test suites long-lived and healthy -- from test strategy and tools all the way to coding practices.</p>]]></description>

<title>How do I do CD with Go?: Part 2: Pipelines and Value Streams</title>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>A Go Pipeline does not necessarily map one-to-one with what is referred to as the automated deployment pipeline in continuous delivery literature. The automated deployment pipeline is essentially the end-to-end CD value stream. This end to end value stream is often better modeled using multiple Go Pipelines.
For very simple cases, it may be enough to model the entire value stream inside a single Go Pipeline as the diagram in the documentation suggests.</p>]]></description>

Infrastructure automation and the design of build pipelines? The biggest constraint to being able to incrementally roll out new features are oftentimes the problems in the design of the system itself. And this is often drowned in the CD conversation. To enable rapid, frequent release, it is essential to understand the kinds of constraints we should consider when evolving the architecture of our systems.</p>]]></description>

As a result, a lot of vendors have jumped onto the bandwagon. Most products that have anything to do with deployment now try to associate themselves with devops and continuous delivery. In this webinar, Sriram will try to clear the air in a product independent manner. He will also cover common devops anti-patterns and explain the idea of infrastructure as code.</p>]]></description>

While we know that Mac is not a serious platform for production installations of Go, it is often the first system where Go is installed – to evaluate or try out things.  Considering this, Go has always supported Mac.  However, thanks to security changes made by Apple from OSX 10.7 (a.k.a Lion), Go installation broke on Mac. There was a workaround of course, but it is not the same.
The Go 12.3.1 app for Mac works on Lion and Mountain Lion.  We believe this will help potential evaluators, anyone who wants to try out Go on their laptops.</p>]]></description>

During a tour by the museum director we were looking at a mid-1930′s Santo Domingo Pueblo (New Mexico) necklace. “Interesting about this necklace,” the director said, “are the ‘nots’– not coral, not obsidian (but old melted phonograph records for the black element). During the depression the Native American artists were constrained by the lack of materials. Everyone thinks that creativity and innovation are driven by freedom. In the art world they are often driven instead by the constraints.”</p>]]></description>

One of the toughest delivery impediments I had to constantly deal with was the ubiquitous silo. Assuming you have a functional* team, based on trial and error and about 500 “whys”, my recommendation on how to crush silos is to concentrate on the points where work needs to move from one role to another. Delivery management to me is about maintaining a steady flow of the most important work between all roles.</p>]]></description>

Cutting lead time from 6 months to 3 months turns out to be easy. That’s just smart scope management and getting people to actually talk to each other. But going from months to weeks, or even to days? Most teams hit a wall. This proves to be a chasm many cannot cross.
The good news is that the teams who are doing this all have one thing in common. They all like to fail fast.</p>]]></description>

The write-up assumes that sonar maven plugin will be used to do analysis. 
Let us start by having a pipeline with two stages, “build” and “test”. 
Set up a new stage "quality".
Add a new job “sonar”
Add a new “Custom Command”</p>]]></description>

This talk will introduce the principles and practices of Continuous Delivery, an approach pioneered by companies like Facebook, Flickr and Thoughtworks, that aims to make it possible for an organization to deliver frequently (weekly, daily or even hourly) and confidently. It uses idea -> live (the time from idea being conceived until the feature is live) as a key metric, minimizing that metric across the whole path to production.</p>]]></description>

However, when I took over tech lead duties I had the opportunity to revisit many of the technical decisions we had made.  Rails was the first topic I approached.  I'll cover the technical nitty gritty of the approach we'll be taking in a later entry but for now I want to talk about the Why.

This means that every binary built could potentially be released to production in a matter of minutes or seconds, if the powers that be so wish.</p>]]></description>

The Agile scaling myth goes something like this: “Agile development works well for smaller projects, but doesn’t scale to larger ones.” Which raises questions like: “At what size does delivering value to customers fail to be important?” and “Can large organizations afford to be inflexible, rigid, and unresponsive?” </p>]]></description>

Scope creep is nasty, and left unchecked may cause blindness or death.</p>]]></description>

As most Agile and Kanban teams know, user stories can help teams collaborate around bite-sized chunks of work. The single, trackable user story allows teams to measure and sustain a constant flow of work. And yet, I have noticed that as teams become more proficient at establishing a flow, the usefulness of the user story as a way to communicate customer value diminishes severely.</p>]]></description>

By highlighting different scope change scenarios, the chart helps teams better understand likely delivery dates based on how scope may change.
The Mingle team have found the forecasting chart a useful tool, as have some of our customers. That said, it's worth discussing how we generate the chart, both to better understand the logic behind what is being communicated, and to collect feedback on how to improve the way we calculate forecasts.</p>]]></description>

While there is no right or wrong answer, we recommend objectives be identified by the value they deliver to the customer and the business.

We believe this type of naming will help keep value and purpose at the forefront of your program and guide conversations to focus on their delivery.</p>]]></description>

Pro tip 1:  executives do not have time for you to dim the lights and show them forty slides with charts composed of animated dancing leprechauns and flashing arrows that emerge from the void in a checkerboard pattern.

Part of this process involves thinking about how our products reflect our values. We value, among other things, collaboration and transparency, so we try to build products that promote conversations and improve visibility.</p>]]></description>

You may not have pictured it this way, but your agile team members are going to be the same people you worked with before, when you were all doing waterfall!  I know I wasn't picturing it that way for my first agile team, so I thought I should warn you.  (I thought I was going to get between six and eight original Agile Manifesto signers.  That didn't happen.).</p>]]></description>

You probably think this will involve yourself talking and your client respectfully listening.  Your client will put you in front of her team to present a PowerPoint deck outlining how Everything Will Be Different Now.  You will then distribute copies of your Initiative Plan to each of her subordinates.  Once you have given everyone their marching orders, they will do exactly what you outlined in orderly fashion.</p>]]></description>

As we all know, the PO must be empowered to make decisions, yet must also be knowledgeable enough about what the software should do that she can make constant small decisions for the team so they don't have to wait.  The PO understands the big picture, understands the small picture, and can set priorities.</p>]]></description>

After all, agile is all about the "self governing team."  But in the real world, if you are in a company which is transitioning to agile, and you are the project manager of a newly created agile team, you may well need to consider how to create a situation around your team that allows self-governance to emerge without making you completely crazy.  In real life, your first few weeks with your agile team can seem like your worst nightmare.</p>]]></description>

There will be 3-D box diagrams and arrows on it for sure, along with many links and appendices.  The diagrams and artifact templates themselves will go through weeks or months of review before central posting, not to mention what will theoretically happen if your project adheres to the highly edited result.</p>]]></description>

I didn't find anything that jumped out to me as a #failure in a particularly #horrifying way.  Then for a moment I thought maybe I am not one of the #Agile Cool Kids.  Of course the moment was brief and I bounced back quickly--please don't worry. </p>]]></description>

Over the past year Thoughtworks has introduced several technologies and extensions that allow Mingle to more seamlessly integration into the Microsoft Office and development ecosystem. We have started three open-source projects supporting this effort:
Mingle.NET – A library wrapping Mingle’s REST API that is easily consumed by clients written in C#, Visual Basic or C++.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>Organize software delivery around outcomes, not roles: continuous delivery and cross-functional teams. When implementing continuous delivery, it’s easy to focus on automation and tooling because these are usually the easiest things to start with. However continuous delivery also relies for its success on optimizing your organizational structure for throughput. One of the biggest barriers we at Thoughtworks have seen to continuous delivery is teams organized by role or by tier, rather than by business outcome.</p>]]></description>

Two technologies are revolutionizing service delivery for social-mission organizations, enabling them to expand their reach to more people, in more places than ever.
We live in a time of global revolution: a revolution enabled by technology and, as with all revolutions, driven by people. It’s not a socio-political revolution like the Arab Spring or the Occupy/99% movement; though those movements have been substantially enabled by technology.</p>]]></description>

Take a big step away from the Agile Manifesto and think for a moment about project stakeholders, user stories, and how they don't fit together as neatly in real life as they do in Mike Cohn's User Stories Applied, as awesome as that book is.  How in the world is it possible for there to be a single person standing in for all project stakeholders in negotiating with the team?

It is for this reason that, we tend to avoid recommending ‘best practices’ that all software teams can follow for success, let alone ‘agility’.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/meta/insights/in_meta_blogs.jpg" height="500" width="332"/><p>Even though Go 2.0 was only released one month ago, we've already been hard at work adding features for our forthcoming Go 2.1 release. Since Go is supposed to enable rapid, reliable releases, we thought we should demonstrate that we are practicing what we preach. The team is ensuring that Go remains production-ready throughout our development lifecycle, and to prove it - and give you the ability to try out the latest features - we're planning on releasing early access builds every few weeks throughout the development lifecycle.</p>]]></description>

I’m a Project Manager. It is what “I Was Meant To Do”. When a project appears anywhere in my life, I get a compulsion to actively manage it. I try to back off and just go with the flow. “This isn’t work. It’s just a hobby (or vacation, or kid birthday party, or whatever), " I tell myself. "Stop taking it so seriously." But then I get twitchy. I wake up in the middle of the night thinking of work break down structures. I start sketching out high-level project plans in my head.</p>]]></description>

Where people inside the industry differ is how to accomplish that testing, as strategies vary by level of the application tested, tools, methodology, amount of automation, and who completes the testing itself. The aspirational desire is to ship high-quality bug-free software no matter how one gets there. However, the devil is in the details.

The promise of quality software

Central to creating a testing strategy that works are four essential questions:</p>]]></description>

There, I asked the question, “Can Agile succeed in an organization that values single point accountability?” Much to my surprise, the panel was stumped!  “I don’t know.”  “I’m not sure, maybe.”  “Good question.” Once I got over the initial geeky pride-glow of having stumped the experts, I was deeply troubled.  The question plagued me day and night. I desperately needed to know. </p>]]></description>

The interesting outcome is that this feature can be used to get the dependencies between stories. Let me explain how. When you use Twist during the early phases to write the acceptance tests (intents) for each story or feature - such as

They have three stages in one pipeline, and the first stage for unit test, the second one for  server deployment, and the last one for functional test which will hit the servers that deployed in the previous stage 'deployServer'.
The unit test stage runs faster than the other two, so it is possable to deploy a new version of the application at the time the functional test is running if checkin frequently.</p>]]></description>

Part of this is due to the increase in quantitative management practices in business, the trend being to measure everything in sight in an effort to show change in performance over time as well as competitiveness (to the extent possible) relative to commercial peers. But part of this is also self-inflicted: long delivery horizons punctuated by abstract milestones make IT opaque. This puts IT under increased pressure to produce performance and quality metrics.</p>]]></description>
