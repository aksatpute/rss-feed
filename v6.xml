If you explore some of China’s most popular websites and apps, such as 163.com (news), Jing Dong (e-commerce), Taobao (e-commerce) and Didi (ride-sharing), you will find that they have high information and feature density and highly saturated colors. 
Why is this?

In this remote work "Big Bang", we realized that the challenges of teamwork are intensified due to variables that go beyond the project itself. The team is made of people, and people have different routines, habits, and in most cases, different time zones.

At Thoughtworks, we strongly believe in pairing not just for programming, but also for most of our everyday activities. In fact, this very post is a result of pairing!

Many I’ve been part of seem to have become a box ticking exercise rather than a key problem solving activity. I’ve seen teams rush through them, forget them, or even disregard them.

Pair programming
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. It is a relatively controversial practice among all of the agile methods, if not the most. In fact, only a few teams that adopt it can actually benefit from it. For the rest, even if they claim they are doing agile, they will often be divided into two camps.</description><pubDate>Mon Nov 25 10:30:00 UTC 2019</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/seven-principles-pair-programming-etiquette</link><author>Juntao Qiu</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_060.jpg"/></item><item><title>How many programming languages should your business support?</title><description>Choose a number between one and 100

Soon the number of problems grows beyond your capacity to handle them all in a timely fashion, and a queue of problems emerges ready for your sage advice that no one else seems able to offer.</description><pubDate>Tue Jan 27 12:58:00 UTC 2015</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/leading-questions</link><author>Darren Smith</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_100.jpg"/></item><item><title>The Year of the ‘Marginal Win’</title><description>In an election year in the UK, it struck me that 2015 could be redefining in both the political and retail landscape.

UX should be an insurance to minimise the fail rate of your product by telling you what will fail before you finish building it.
If you still don't have a UX designer on your team, stop reading and get one! For the rest of us, your project's risk might not be on the UX insurance coverage just yet if it's displaying one of these four symptoms.

Okay, so we know what beacons are and what they do - great. The next question is, what can we do with them? What kinds of interactions can we craft?
That's the question my collaborator Nick Urban and I decided to pick apart. We sliced beacon interactions up, to show in a clear and non-technical way what they are really made of. In this article we will walk through the slices.</description><pubDate>Fri Apr 25 10:30:00 UTC 2014</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/beacon-interaction-design-a-glossary</link><author>Andrew McWilliams</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_100.jpg"/></item><item><title>Technology Improves Healthcare Delivery in Kenya</title><description>Ozge Catalbas is the Tech Lead on the Humanitarian Software Program (HSP) at Thoughtworks; an initiative where we partner with humanitarian and social organizations, to provide voluntary software development and consulting services, pro-bono. Ozge is passionate about forming productive dev teams and delivering high quality software.</description><pubDate>Fri Apr 25 10:30:00 UTC 2014</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/delivering-health-services-and-research-kenya</link><author>Ozge Catalbas</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_077.jpg"/></item><item><title>3 Pointers to Add Agility to Testing</title><description>On one of my first projects at Thoughtworks I found myself confronted with a legacy codebase. The tech stack was a Drupal with lots of PHP to customize the CMS with Java based Selenium 1.0 tests on the side. It was not created to test the app comprehensively, and there were gaping holes. The Selenium 1.0 suite consisted of a few UI-driven tests representing user interactions. They took 100 minutes to run and did not even discover critical failures.

Here is how I approached this problem and the lessons I learned along the way.</description><pubDate>Wed Apr 23 16:01:00 UTC 2014</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/3-pointers-add-agility-testing</link><author>Torsten Leibrich</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_060.jpg"/></item><item><title>Mission Complete: The International Space Apps Challenge </title><description>The International Space Apps is a 36-hour hackathon that takes place in numerous cities all over the world (including the TW Office in Porto Alegre).</description><pubDate>Wed Apr 23 10:30:00 UTC 2014</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/hacking-international-space-apps-challenge</link><author>Stacey Watro, Matthew Lui, Amber Houle, Aubrey Chipman, Stephen Winter</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_100.jpg"/></item><item><title>The Purpose of Estimation</title><description>My first encounter with agile software development was working with Kent Beck at the dawn of Extreme Programming.

The team can take advantage of the cloud as a tool to assure quality, rather than viewing it as an extra aspect that needs to be tested.</description><pubDate>Thu Feb 13 10:30:00 UTC 2014</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/how-can-cloud-improve-your-apps-quality</link><author>Max Lincoln</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_100.jpg"/></item><item><title>Big Data Reality Causes Privacy Concerns</title><description>Twice a year, Thoughtworks publishes the “Technology Radar”—our view on the technology trends that are important in the industry right now, and the trends that will be important in the near future.</description><pubDate>Tue Feb 11 10:30:00 UTC 2014</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/big-data-reality-causes-privacy-concerns</link><author>Mike Mason</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_077.jpg"/></item><item><title>Ownership Transfer of an Agile Program</title><description>In this article, we discuss the various techniques we adopted to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and ownership of the platform of a train ticket retailer in the UK, which was built and enhanced by Thoughtworks over five years.</description><pubDate>Sun Feb 09 10:30:00 UTC 2014</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/knowledge-and-ownership-transfer-agile-program</link><author>Vinod Sankaranarayanan</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_060.jpg"/></item><item><title>Continuous Delivery (to the pub)</title><description>Think of the times you've planned to leave work and go to a restaurant, pub, or the like with a few of your colleagues.

Thirsty worker #1: "I'll send an email to everyone asking who wants to go to the pub after work"

Thirsty workers #2 to #6 all reply that they do.

Thirsty worker #7 says, "I just need to finish a few things off.

You have a product and want to encourage more people to complete a specific task. You have 2 ideas, you decide to A/B test them to see which is better. So, you put your users into two groups (A and B) where each group sees a different solution, and then measure which group is more successful at completing the task. After 200 total tests, 30 out of 100 people in Group A completed the task, while 40 out of 100 people in Group B completed the task.

Do you hear this on your project? Are your tests flaky? Does the build change from green to red and back again without any real explanation? What are you doing about it?

Recently I joined a project that had this problem. It's quite normal to encounter it and it's quite common to get around it by just running the test again. Some teams had actually added scripts to pick up failed tests and run them again automatically at the end of the same build, in case they pass the second time around.</description><pubDate>Wed Jan 01 10:30:00 UTC 2014</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/just-re-run-build-it-should-go-green</link><author>Neil Philip Craven</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_060.jpg"/></item><item><title>Thoughtworkers Join the Stop Watching Us Rally </title><description>This past October, I was one of many Thoughtworkers who attended the Rally Against Mass Surveillance in Washington, DC.  The rally was organized by Stop Watching Us, a consortium of many civil rights advocacy groups and other organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Demand Progress, and the ACLU.  It was planned to coincide with the 13th anniversary of the passage into law of the Patriot Act.</description><pubDate>Wed Jan 01 09:30:00 UTC 2014</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/thoughtworkers-join-stop-watching-us-rally</link><author>Thoughtworks</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_100.jpg"/></item><item><title>2013 A Year In Review</title><description>2013 was a big year for Thoughtworks in the online space.

It was interesting to see the problems that were identified and explored and exciting to watch the groups use design thinking (a totally new topic for many) to try to solve those problems. Below are the key take-aways from our workshop--these are good general guidelines for anyone to follow when approaching problem solving.

This article is the first in a series where we paint a picture of a Thoughtworks analytics engagement. We'll focus here on the concept of the data lab, where a data science team explores data, hypotheses, and quantitative methodologies to answer core business questions with advanced analytics.
A Picture of an Agile Analytics Engagement
Advanced analytics is an umbrella term that covers a wide swath of tools and techniques, all rooted in rigorous statistics. A data science team is not only able to solve IT problems, but can answer any quantitative question that is at the heart of a business. When visualizing metrics means you can better monitor the health of your business processes and capital, we can design and build out effective, tailored dashboard reporting tools. When you want deeper insight on what drives value for your shareholders, we can analyze a far wider variety of data sources than is typically used in traditional business intelligence. And when you want to increase revenue with targeted recommendations and personalization, we bring expertise in sophisticated machine learning techniques to the table. Wherever it is possible to answer valuable business questions with real data, there is an opportunity to engage a data science team.
So how might an agile analytics engagement unfold?  The following picture illustrates a model for applying agile methodologies to data science analytics.</description><pubDate>Thu Aug 01 10:30:00 UTC 2013</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/discovery-data-lab-part-1</link><author>Will High</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_060.jpg"/></item><item><title>Get better in 2 minutes: Part 3 - Mingle + Cycle Time Analytics</title><description>As part of our series on cycle time, we’ve covered what cycle time is, why it matters, and how you can use it to know if you're improving.

We treat all our virtual servers as immutable. When we upgrade our system we create brand new servers and destroy the old ones, rather than upgrading them in-place.

Abstract
Nowadays, it is hard to justify a large part of a project’s design budget on three months creative direction, where screens of every potential stage of an application are mocked up before development even begins. Clients now see the risk in spending too much early on in the project as it leaves very little time and budget to incorporate important changes later on in the project.</description><pubDate>Sun Jun 09 10:30:00 UTC 2013</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/providing-just-enough-design-can-make-agile-software-delivery-more-successful</link><author>Eewei Chen</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_077.jpg"/></item><item><title>Evolving our release process - fun time lapse video</title><description>To help us better understand how our release process has evolved over time, the Go product manager Marco, created the following video and shared it with us.

One of the great things about the cloud is the way you can just run a bit of code or a bash script and before a Windows admin can open their GUI you’ve got a running box. This opens up a host of opportunities and new patterns. Martin Fowler recently posted about the Phoenix Server pattern where machines are simply thrown away rather than upgraded. But these things require looking at the way you architect infrastructure slightly differently.</description><pubDate>Wed May 01 14:38:00 UTC 2013</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/layering-cloud</link><author>Peter Gillard-Moss</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_060.jpg"/></item><item><title>Twist execution hooks and customizable HTML reports - Part 1</title><description>This blog post talks about measuring the execution time for each step and reporting it in Twist HTML reports.

Being agile is much more than applying some techniques to run software projects - it requires a commitment to adaptive leadership, a focus on delivering value fast, and a different understanding of what your organizations' portfolio should look like.
This webinar will investigate some of the key changes to becoming agile, with points learned from Thoughtworks' own journey, and the work we have done with clients around the world. It will be challenging and thought-provoking, providing you with some key aspects of change you can use to lead your organization on its journey.</description><pubDate>Tue Apr 30 15:30:00 UTC 2013</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/webinar-agile-leadership</link><author>Chad Wathington</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_077.jpg"/></item><item><title>Distributed teams and avoiding face time bias</title><description>Companies rarely promote people into leadership roles who haven’t been consistently seen and measured. It’s a familiarity thing, and it’s a trust thing. We’re not saying that the people who get promoted are stars during every “crucible” moment at the office, but at least they’re present and accounted for. And their presence says: Work is my top priority. I’m committed to this company. I want to lead. And I can.
- Jack and Suzie Welch in a 2007 Business Week column 

After all the hullabaloo about Yahoo eliminating its work from home policy I thought a lot about how distributed work is part of everyday life on many Thoughtworks teams.

Directly, the words "careful and diligent" invoke the idea of letting a computer program do the job. Automating certain programmable aspects of your test suite thus can help software delivery massively. In most of the projects that I have worked on, there were aspects of testing which could be automated, and then there were some that couldn't. Nonetheless, my teams could rely heavily on our automation suite when we had one, and spend our energies testing aspects of the application we could not cover with automated functional tests. Also, automating tests helped us immensely to meet customer demands for quick changes, and subsequently reaching a stage where every build, even ones with very small changes went out tested and verified from our stable. As Jez rightly says in his excellent text about Continuous Delivery, automated tests "take delivery teams beyond basic continuous integration" and on to the path of continuous delivery.</description><pubDate>Sun Dec 16 17:53:00 UTC 2012</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/why-test-automation-backbone-continuous-delivery</link><author>Ranjan Sakalley</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_060.jpg"/></item><item><title>How we use Mingle for Product Management</title><description>Here on the Mingle team we use Mingle not only as a way to manage our day-to-day software delivery and development, but also as a tool for product management.

The Go 12.3.1 app for Mac works on Lion and Mountain Lion.  We believe this will help potential evaluators, anyone who wants to try out Go on their laptops.</description><pubDate>Tue Oct 09 06:50:00 UTC 2012</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/what-new-1231</link><author>Go Team</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_077.jpg"/></item><item><title>Lean card wall: "Today" view</title><description>I’ve worked with teams who have some fairly sophisticated card walls, in terms of columns (some even warranted!).

When implementing continuous delivery, it’s easy to focus on automation and tooling because these are usually the easiest things to start with.

One of the biggest barriers we at Thoughtworks have seen to continuous delivery is teams organized by role or by tier, rather than by business outcome.</description><pubDate>Sun Dec 18 18:01:00 UTC 2011</pubDate><link>https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/organize-software-delivery-around-outcomes</link><author>Jez Humble</author><media:content medium="image" url="https://cdntest.webteam.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/images/photography/abstract/insights/blog/tx_content_card_100.jpg"/></item><item><title>Mobile Networks and Cloud-Hosted Services</title><description>Together they can revolutionize aid to the developing world.
